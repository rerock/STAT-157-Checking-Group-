Group Project goal
--------
Our overall group goal is to check the reproducibility of other groups work on the project. 
- We will be checking other groupâ€™s codes, graphs and analysis, make sure it is well documented and reproducible. 
- We will be writing the python code that will pipe together the different R code. 

Our plan is to create an overarching Python code that controls the different blocks of R code and that it can be called just once. 
This will ensure that our project remains centralized. Moreover, this will also decrease the complexity of having different code base 
for different part of the project.
