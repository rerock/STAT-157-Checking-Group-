Road Blocks
------
(11-18-13) It is difficult to plan ahead of time our schedule since we just start this group task and many groups have not 
started/finished any of their work. 

(11-21-13) It is difficult to keep in track with every groups process. We went throught group evaluations and repos, but not every group has
done something that we can check in and not everything is planned as scheduled. 

Solutions
-----
(11-18-13) We tried to look through the group evaluations and their repos. We found out the Quakers have finished 
their R code on [error diagrams](https://github.com/SunnySunnia/TheQuakers/blob/master/MDA/mda_test.r)
of testing u from 4.7 to 6 based off
[Luen’s code](https://github.com/SunnySunnia/TheQuakers/blob/master/MDA/etas-training.R). 
Our immediate SMART goal for this 
week is to start attempting to call R from ipynb and to check the reproducibility of the Quaker’s code.

(11-21-13) Talked with Kristina, hope to have a point of contact from each group. Meantime, we will
  - Check whether we can run `aftershock_arrival_plots.ipynb` & `mda_with_curator_data.ipynb` from the [analyzers group](https://github.com/stat157/analyzers/tree/master/notebooks)
  - Check whether the python code base can also be called on the [plotting successors.R file](http://github.com/SunnySunnia/TheQuakers/tree/master/Successors) from the Quakers. 
  - Create a summary of what other groups are doing and what we have done/can do with their codes/graphs.
